# Credit Card Approval Risk Predictor

## Project Overview

Banks receive numerous credit card applications, many of which are rejected due to reasons like high loan balances, low income, or multiple credit inquiries. Analyzing these applications manually is error-prone and time-consuming. This project automates the approval process using machine learning techniques, similar to how real banks operate.
